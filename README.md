# Github actions Node 20 react app build template
This is a template repoistory set up that it builds react spa application using github actions on every new release. The build is done on ubuntu-latest runner and uses node 20. The build is done using `npm ci` and `npm run build`. In addition to saving the built output to artifact, 2nd job builds the static html/css/js and pushes it to the nginx container togather with nginx config for spa so that it can be
hosted using anything that can run a docker container.

## Requirements for docker container build
You need to have the following secrets set up in your github either on organization or repository level. If you are using repository level secrets with environments, uncomment the `environment` section in the github workflow file and replace it with the name of your environment.

| Secret Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| DOCKER_LOGIN_SERVER | The server URL of the docker registry.|
| DOCKER_USERNAME | The username to login to the docker registry.|
| DOCKER_PASSWORD | The password to login to the docker registry.|

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
